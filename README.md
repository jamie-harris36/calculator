## Project Development & Planning
Throughout the development of this calculator, I followed the principles of User Experience (UX), which include the following 5 steps:
1. Strategy
2. Scope
3. Structure
4. Skeleton
5. Surface

I wanted to ensure the website was easy to use, responsive, accessible and intuitive as well as meeting the needs of the user.

### Project Goals

#### **Project Purpose**

A web-based calculator that allows users to input their annual salary, which will then display results on tax deductions, national insurance deductions and after tax (net) salary based on what amount the user inputs. I would like to stress that I am not an accountant or a tax expert, and tax laws are very complicated, because of this these results won't always be 100% accurate. They should be taken as rough estimations of take-home pay for entertainment and educational purposes, and not fully relied on to the exact amount. 

#### **Client Goals**

This calculator was built as my second milestone project on my Level 5 Diploma in Web Application Development [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) as part of my interactive frontend development modules, and my first project where use of JavaScript is essential. Because of this, I didn't have a specific client.

However, to practice making my projects look professional, I treated this as a real-world application which could be used by banks or other financial institutes. This clients goals would be:
* Engaging users with interactivity and providing them with a rough estimate on the users tax deductions and take-home pay.
* Helping users to know if their income requires them to pay tax, and if so, roughly how much they will pay.
* Helping users to see yearly, monthly and weekly values, depending on how frequently they are paid.

#### **User Goals**

The audience for this calculator would be people who are employed on a PAYE (Pay as you earn) basis, and would like to estimate how much they would be paid without having to dig out their payslips or P60. The audience would also extend to people who are just curious how much their take-home pay would be if they were to start work at a particular job where the yearly salary is displayed on a job description.
User Goals:
* Showing the user a rough estimate on what their take-home pay would be based on a yearly salary they input.
* Showing the user how much of their gross (pre-taxed) income is paid in tax.
* Showing the user which tax bands they pay into (20%, 40% and 45%) and how much is paid in each tax band.
* Showing the user how much of their gross income is paid towards National Insurance contributions.
