This is the documentation for my web application: The PAYE Take-Home Pay Calculator. It has been built using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript for educational purposes as part of Code Institute's Level 5 Diploma in Web Application Development course.

## Project Development & Planning
Throughout the development of this calculator, I followed the principles of User Experience (UX), which include the following 5 steps:
1. Strategy
2. Scope
3. Structure
4. Skeleton
5. Surface

I wanted to ensure the website was easy to use, responsive, accessible and intuitive as well as meeting the needs of the user.

### Project Goals

#### **Project Purpose**

A web-based calculator that allows users to input their annual salary, which will then display results on tax deductions, national insurance deductions and after tax (net) salary based on what amount the user inputs. 

I would like to stress that I am not an accountant or a tax expert, and tax laws are very complicated, because of this these results won't always be 100% accurate. 

They should be taken as rough estimations of take-home pay for entertainment and educational purposes, and not fully relied on to the exact amount. With that being said, the rates and thresholds for both income tax and national insurance, as well as the personal allowance, are accuarate as of the financial year of 2024/25.

#### **Client Goals**

This calculator was built as my second milestone project on my Level 5 Diploma in Web Application Development [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) as part of my interactive frontend development modules, and my first project where use of JavaScript is essential. Because of this, I didn't have a specific client.

However, to practice making my projects look professional, I treated this as a real-world application which could be used by banks or other financial institutes. This clients goals would be:
* Engaging users with interactivity and providing them with a rough estimate on the users tax deductions and take-home pay.
* Helping users to know if their income requires them to pay tax, and if so, roughly how much they will pay.
* Helping users to see yearly, monthly and weekly values, depending on how frequently they are paid.

#### **User Goals**

The audience for this calculator would be people who are employed on a PAYE (Pay as you earn) basis, and would like to estimate how much they would be paid without having to dig out their payslips or P60. The audience would also extend to people who are just curious how much their take-home pay would be if they were to start work at a particular job where the yearly salary is displayed on a job description.
User Goals:
* Showing the user a rough estimate on what their take-home pay would be based on a yearly salary they input.
* Showing the user how much of their gross (pre-taxed) income is paid in tax.
* Showing the user which tax bands they pay into (20%, 40% and 45%) and how much is paid in each tax band.
* Showing the user how much of their gross income is paid towards National Insurance contributions.

### Research

I looked at a variety of online take-home pay calculators. I looked at the style and content of the style and content of their calculators, and also how the results were presented. 

I also compared the results between each of these calculators that's displayed when I input an annual salary. I'm aware that all of these calculators are rough estimates because of how complicated the tax system can be, it would be difficult for the results to be 100% accurate. With that being said, the websites I researched are listed below.

#### **The Salary Calculator**

I really liked the layout of this calculator. I decided to simplify things though. This calculator let the user add certain options, such as inputting their own individual tax code, bonuses, pension contributions, salary sacrifice and more. 

However I wanted the user to feel like they were using a much simpler calulation, where they'd just insert their annual salary and they'd get a rough but fairly accurate estimation on what their take-home salary would be. I also wanted the calculator to be simple enough to be displayed on the entire viewport without the user having to scroll down the page.

I also liked whenever I click on the 'Tax breakdown' link, a modal shows up with the yearly, monthly and weekly breakdowns of the amounts paid within the relevant tax bands, and I wanted to incorporate this into my project too.

Here is a link to [The Salary Calculator](https://www.thesalarycalculator.co.uk/salary.php).

#### **Gov.uk Income Tax Calculator**

I like the layout of this calculator as well, especially when the results are displayed. I like how the amounts paid within the relevant tax bands are displayed without having to click on a link to display a modal. I preferred the layout of the Salary calculator though, so I based a lot of my design on that layout.

Here is a link to the [Gov.uk Income Tax Calculator](https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/estimate-paye-take-home-pay/your-pay).

#### **HMRC Income Tax and National Insurance Rates**

I researched the current income tax and national insurance rates, personal allowance and individual tax bands, to ensure the results are as accurate as possible. However I simplified the national insurance deductions, to assume that the user is being deducted class 1 contributions.

Here are links to both [Income Tax Rates & Personal Allowances](https://www.gov.uk/income-tax-rates) and [National Insurance Rates](https://www.gov.uk/national-insurance/how-much-you-pay).


#### **Research of peoples salarys**

I didn't want to be rude and ask for the salaries of my loved ones, but I did ask my partner, and my dad to use my calculator and tell me if their monthly take-home salary is close to the results that showed up. I did this so I knew whether my calculator was at least on the right track or not in terms of accuracy. I'll talk about this more on the user stories below.
